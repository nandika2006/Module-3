# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program :

    items=[1,2,-8]
    s=0
    for i in items:
        s+=i
    print(s)

## Output :

<img width="842" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cca19942-c7ac-4758-9fac-ec45b16da04f" />


## Result :
Thus the program that calculates the sum of all elements in a list has been executed successfully.
